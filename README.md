# [aircall.io](https://aircall.io) - Android technical test

This test is part of our hiring process at Aircall for [Android Software Engineer positions](https://aircall.io/jobs). You'll have to do it on site within 2h30.

**Feel free to apply! Drop us a line with your LinkedIn/GitHub/Twitter/AnySocialProfileWhereYouAreActive at jobs@aircall.io**


## Summary

The goal of this test is to make you code a small Android app from scratch. You are free to use the libraries you need and the architecture you find the most appropriate.

Your app must implement the following scenario:

1. Main screen will display a list of calls (Activity Feed)
2. Tapping on a call will navigate to a call detail
3. End user should be able to navigate in app without a working Internet connection (offline mode)
4. End user should be able to archive a call from the Activity Detail page. Once archived, the call will no longer be displayed on the Activity Feed


Try to finish as many steps as you can in 2h30 - it's ok if you don't complete all the tasks :)

Don't spend too much time on designing your app, we'll only look at your code architecture.
